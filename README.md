## Delivery

Every phone opens the same public conversation. No password, device pairing, or plugin setup. The owner explicitly accepts public reading and ordinary message posting. Anyone finding the URL can do both.

The Azure Storage static website serves the lightweight application shell. Cloudflare stores messages, replies, and briefings in the existing SQLite Durable Object binding. The assistant publishes structured comments through the connected GitHub account in issue #2. Cloudflare accepts only comments authored by owner ID 183016859, validates their schema, and imports them into SQLite. Ordinary visitors cannot publish assistant replies or briefings.

Replies and briefings are data: publishing a comment does not redeploy either website or Worker. The site polls every 30 seconds while visible. Cloudflare checks GitHub at most once per five minutes when the inbox is read, shared across all visitors. Imported entries remain available if GitHub is unavailable. The reply-delivery status is reported separately from message storage.

Ordinary reply bodies are limited to 6,000 characters. Daily Board briefing bodies may contain up to 20,000 characters; titles remain limited to 120 characters.

The importer is append-only. Do not edit or delete published comments to correct entries: these changes do not remove already imported data. Reply targets and dated briefings are deduplicated. Conflicting publications preserve the first accepted entry and appear in reader diagnostics. GitHub pagination resumes after outages or large backlogs.

## Safe rollout

`public/assets/config.js` contains `DIRECT_API_ENABLED`. While false, the main chat uses the existing legacy shared inbox and checked-in publication file. The reader tries the new API first and reports if the backend upgrade is unavailable. Enable the flag only after the live reader confirms version 6, the actual GitHub reply, and the Daily Board test. This prevents a delayed Cloudflare deployment from breaking the existing site.

The new Worker retains legacy APIs for recovery. Old user messages and trusted checked-in replies/briefings are copied into the shared SQLite store without deleting originals. Legacy assistant/board API rows cannot acquire trusted publication status. Offline drafts and retry queues stay on the phone; successful sends are identified by UUID for safe retries.

## Assistant handoff

See [JARVIS-HANDOFF.md](JARVIS-HANDOFF.md). Scheduling is configured in a separate chat after live delivery is verified. Do not claim an hourly task is active until an actual scheduled run succeeds. Quick Chat and other modules remain future work.

## Deployment and costs

GitHub main is the source. `public/` is published to the Azure Storage static website `missionarytube` by the existing pinned-release workflow in the Missionarytube repository, which validates the public Quick AI configuration and injects the unrelated Drive key and backs up current blobs before upload. There is no frontend build or Azure API deployment. The former Static Web App (`gray-meadow-09216fd10`) is retired: its deploy workflow was removed and the Worker no longer accepts its origin. `public/staticwebapp.config.json` is ignored by Storage hosting, so its per-route security headers do not apply there. Keep large media and data outside Azure.

Cloudflare uses the existing `jarvis-hub-api` Worker and existing `HUBS` SQLite Durable Object binding. Build settings: root `/backend`, build command empty, deploy command `npx wrangler deploy`, production branch `main`. No new binding or paid resource is required.

No paid upgrade, billing entry, or paid service is authorized. Free-tier limits can interrupt service. Public messages have an application cap of 200 new messages per UTC day, but this does not replace provider limits or a verified Free plan.

## Development

Native JavaScript modules and system fonts; no frontend dependencies. Add future routes under `public/`. Only Quick Chat keys that the owner has explicitly designated public may be placed in its static configuration; keep all other credentials out of browser code.

Run `npm test`. Tests exercise migration, preserved drafts, untrusted-role rejection, SQLite pagination, owner-only publication parsing, retries, outage recovery, backlog continuation, and duplicate prevention. Before deploying, run a Wrangler dry-run; before activating the new UI adapter, verify the live reply and briefing round trip.

## Quick Chat public configuration

Quick Chat runs in the browser. It calls Gemini `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, Qwen `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` on Groq, and Tavily Search directly. The owner chose public, free-plan API keys to avoid configuring Cloudflare secrets. Put the three keys in `public/assets/quick-ai-config.json` under `geminiKey`, `groqKey`, and `tavilyKey` when available. They are intentionally visible to anyone who can open the deployed site or public repository. They are not stored in Quick Chat localStorage, sent to Main Chat or Muse, or logged by our code. Verify each provider account has no paid overages before adding its key. The frontend deploy workflow refuses to change live blobs while any of the three values is empty.

Quick Chat keeps its existing `jarvis.quick-ai.v1` text chats and drafts; new image bytes stay in browser IndexedDB. Search sends one editable textual query to Tavily only when enabled, followed by one selected-model request. Google free-tier API data may be used for product improvement. Main Chat and Muse remain on their check-based integrations.

Rollback: pin a previous *public-config* Jarvis revision or disable Quick Chat while preserving the local chat storage. Do not roll back to the older exposed `apiKey` format or reintroduce a Cloudflare Worker dependency. Rotate the old Groq key only after confirming other consumers and the new frontend release.
