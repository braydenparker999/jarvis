# Lucy/Muse execution acceptance

This harness tests execution boundaries independently of the production implementation. A callback receipt, an immutable reply, an authenticated execution claim, a checked result, and typed work completion are distinct observations. A transport pass never establishes that Lucy or Muse actually did the requested work. All automated execution here is an explicitly fictional host. Genuine host acceptance requires an authorized operator and observed execution evidence.

The inspected source base is `braydenparker999/jarvis` at `ea9c09c1ddb172c1f0d668b58a5e7066f1c8318f`. A source merge, test pass, HTTP health response, deployment source identity, and host-callable schema are separate gates. The harness changes no backend, frontend, deployment identity, credentials, live subscriptions or host schedules.

The standalone command preserves failures and does not skip a blocked gate:

```sh
RELAY_EXECUTION_COST_DIR=/tmp/relay-execution-records node --test \
  tests/relay-execution-acceptance.test.js \
  tests/relay-execution-evidence.test.js \
  tests/relay-execution-workerd-cost.test.js
```

Use the existing locked dependencies (`esbuild`, `miniflare`) for workerd costs and a Node runtime supporting `node:sqlite`. The implementation adds no dependencies. Local verification used Node `v24.19.0`, Python `3.12.14`, and Chromium `151.0.7922.173`; these differ from the repository's pinned qualification toolchain and do not constitute immutable CI qualification. Existing browser assertions must retain their required-browser setting; absent browser coverage is a blocker, never a pass.

The loopback harness starts an actual HTTP server, forwards requests to the production Worker and Hub routing, and uses disk-backed SQLite with real transactions. Claims, progress, replies, corrections, history reads and fixture subscriptions cross the external HTTP/MCP boundary, including JSON-RPC and protocol headers. Fictional OAuth issuer state is seeded only for setup; it is not real user authentication. Callback HMACs are checked independently at a second HTTP hop through a fictional egress adapter. External fetches are restricted to fixed fixture GitHub endpoints and fixture egress, with no fallback to real network destinations.

Restart closes/reopens the on-disk backend database, persisted KV/alarm bookkeeping, every Hub instance, and the fictional executor's separate ledger. This is database/Hub/executor-ledger restart coverage within a Node process, not a Cloudflare platform restart, genuine host process restart, or host resubscription test. The only consequential fixture action is a marker in the separate local ledger. The ledger saves request/run/claim identifiers before a claim, verifies a fictional source through HTTP, and reconciles an already observed effect without repeating it. No untrusted Muse source is executed.

| Scenario | Automated oracle | Genuine observation still needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lucy, phone absent | A signed callback 2xx leaves the job queued. Fictional source read, original run, reply and typed completion form one chain. | Closed browser, real owning host trace, independently checked work, matching authenticated completion. |
| Muse, phone absent and hint lost | Independent host HTTP read imports the fixed publication after restart and follows correction pages. | Actual enabled producer run and its normal reconciliation path with no browser or delivered hint. |
| MCP-only hint loss | Exact MCP read must expose the publication without a browser/HTTP importer supplying it. This gate currently **fails**. | An explicit, observed reconciliation owner for hosts that use only MCP. |
| Restart and lost claim response | Durable request/run/event ledger resumes the same accepted run. An unused expired consequential claim cannot start work. | Real host persistence/recovery behavior; server lease expiry alone says nothing about whether external work stopped. |
| Duplicate callback/reply/claim/completion races | Overlapping alarm replies preserve delivered state; only one claim and immutable reply win; identical completion races write one event. | Real host dedupe and a verified count of actual consequential actions. |
| Later correction | Exact HTTP/MCP reads expose version 2 after restart; original reply/completion remain at version 1. Creation cursor does not discover this update. | Real Lucy/Muse observer fetches the exact answered request or the complete changes cursor. |
| Expired/410/413 subscriptions | Diagnostics show no eligible active route; retry returns `retried: 0`; no claim or execution is created. | Existing real route status and an explicit recovery plan. No subscription recreation is implied. |
| Claim/progress/completion ownership | Wrong live grant, run, original reply or result version is refused without durable execution mutations. | Original owning OAuth grant and run remain callable on the genuine host. |
| Transient delivery recovery | Six failed attempts, one bounded metadata recovery, identical no-op replay, unchanged subscription identity/expiry, one local effect. | Recovery of the existing occurrence without replaying an external action. |
| Public result notification | Final/correction updates have `should_execute: false`; old message subscriptions never receive them. | Actual producer consumes updates as data without submitting another execution. |
| Steady cost | Repeated exact boundary reads have equal statement/row costs with 5,000 unrelated background rows. | Deployed read/write accounting and host/provider costs for the exact candidate. |

At the inspected base, `relay_read_public_result` and `relay_read_public_changes` call `sharedStore` directly in `backend/relay-connector.js`. They do not run `syncPublications`. `Hub.alarm()` drains Relay callbacks; it is not a publication reconciler. A newly published final with no delivered hint and no browser reads therefore remains absent to an isolated MCP-only reader, even after Hub restart. The red test is `Muse fixture: lost hint and absent phone recover through host MCP reads after disk/Hub restart`; its first assertion requires a non-null imported reply. The independently passing HTTP recovery case exercises `/shared/result` through Hub reconciliation. It does not close the MCP-only gap or demonstrate a real host executed anything. The parent/core owner must make reconciliation ownership concrete and retain the acceptance assertion.

Reproduce that red gate alone without masking its exit status:

```sh
node --test --test-name-pattern='lost hint and absent phone recover through host MCP' \
  tests/relay-execution-acceptance.test.js
```

Measurement exports are intentionally `scope: loopback-fixture`, `status: observed`, `level: none`. Assertions and the test runner's exit status supply pass/fail evidence separately; even the failing case can export an observation without claiming success. Every export pins the local Git source commit, a SHA-256 over the executable harness/test bytes, runtime, exact request/run/reply/result/completion identifiers when observed, protocol admission outcome, and numeric costs. Fictional publication attempt IDs are carried from the observed result. No body, summary, SQL parameter, authorization header, callback URL, signing secret or private source URL is persisted.

The offline checker validates allowlisted fields and reports missing genuine execution gates:

```sh
node scripts/check-relay-execution-evidence.mjs /tmp/relay-execution-records/RECORD.json
```

The checker makes no network calls and cannot run a host. It refuses private bodies/URLs/secrets, invented enums, invalid identifiers, non-finite costs, an inherited report labeled as a current pass, or a fixture labeled as genuine execution. A genuine execution record must identify the exact deployed source, host source and callable schema; request, real run, immutable reply and result; independent checked source evidence; and reviewed redacted artifacts. Lucy additionally needs the accepted owning-grant/run claim and typed completion. Muse additionally needs a real publication attempt and host trace; a public final is never private job completion. Later corrections can advance the latest result while the original completion remains bound to its earlier version. Hashes reference **redacted evidence artifacts or source code**, never raw private bodies or low-entropy secrets. The checker validates internal consistency; it cannot authenticate an artifact or replace human verification of its contents.

Loopback costs are monotonic elapsed milliseconds, request/response body bytes, SQL statement counts, SQLite returned rows, changed rows, and permitted upstream call counts. Returned rows are not scanned/billed rows. Changed rows count attempted SQLite statement changes, including work subsequently rolled back; they are not an external-effect count. Async-local attribution separates concurrent HTTP requests; an alarm's costs are assigned to that alarm. Setup, cold materialization, warm steady reads and concurrency should be assessed separately. Per-operation p50/p95 and count ranges are available from the checker; small samples are descriptive, not a production latency SLA.

`relay-execution-workerd-cost.test.js` separately measures real local workerd SQL cursor `rowsRead`/`rowsWritten` across the production HTTP/MCP routes, including token verification. It disables only the fixture's timed alarms, rejects all external network, and samples warmed reads before/after 5,000 unrelated processed comments/public entries. On the inspected base:

| Warm operation | SQL statements | workerd rows read | workerd rows written |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `relay_owner_job_read` over MCP | 97 | 30 | 0 |
| `relay_read_public_result` over MCP | 60 | 18 | 0 |
| Authenticated phone `/jobs/detail` | 58 | 15 | 2 |

These counts remain equal at both history sizes. The phone read renews its existing session; the two MCP reads do not. Local latency samples are recorded separately; no model inference latency, real egress pricing, Cloudflare invoice, browser device performance, or real host uptime is inferred. Existing `relay-read-cost.test.js` additionally checks a 5,000-row history: page 416 rows read, rejected hint 7, OAuth registry get 3, FIFO scheduler 5, delivery lookup 6, retention housekeeping 10. Existing tests and their original assertions are left intact.

The current callability distinctions are explicit:

| Layer | What is known on October 9 | What this does not establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source `ea9c09c` | Flat `job_update` catalog exposes inbox/job/run/event/stage/summary/outcome/reply/version fields. Loopback calls succeed with all fields. | Live deployment or host cache refresh. |
| Deployment identity | Must be verified for the actual candidate through deployment evidence. | A frontend pin or source merge independently identifies the live Worker bundle. |
| Cached connector signatures | A generated top-level union can omit common identifiers and summary/reply/version fields even when a tool name is visible. | A valid typed completion is callable; verify every required field on the genuine host. |
| Existing execution claim | An accepted server claim binds a live grant/run and a bounded lease. | Requested work completed or an external action stopped when the lease expired. |
| Producer source and tests | Static source review and producer-reported tests are useful prerequisites. | Genuine execution, activation, or an authorized READY window. |
| New public read/update tools | Candidate catalog exposes them on an opt-in second catalog page. | A cached genuine host can discover/invoke them, or already has an update subscription. |

Before a smallest real-host test, the operator must capture the deployment source/bundle identity and inspect the genuine host's discovered callable schemas using existing authorization. Seeing the tool name is insufficient: the caller must be able to pass every required completion field. This plan requires no UI changes. Do not create a credential, reconnect into a different grant, add/renew a subscription, change a host schedule, activate a producer, run an untrusted script, publish a new request, or perform an upload merely to make a test possible. Missing prerequisites remain explicit blockers.

For an existing interrupted execution, the owning host can reconcile a known terminal outcome after deployment:

1. In the actual owning execution/grant, read the exact private conversation and `relay_owner_job_read` for the already known request UUID. Recover the original `execution.runId`, accepted immutable `result.replyId`, current `resultVersion`, lease timestamps and any pending cancellation. Keep their private bodies out of the evidence artifact. Never impersonate another run or fabricate user auth.
2. Verify independently that the original requested work truly has a known finished outcome. A reply, callback or elapsed lease cannot supply this fact. If it is still blocked/unknown, record that blocker and use only the truthful stage the server permits; do not attest `known` simply to obtain green evidence.
3. Once the flat schema is both live and genuinely callable, submit exactly one `relay_owner_job_update` with `inbox_id: brayden-owner`, that **existing** job/run, a fresh completion event UUID, `stage: completed`, the exact accepted immutable reply UUID, the current result version, a truthful nonblank summary and `outcome: known`. An expired matching execution lease can reconcile a known outcome; the live owning OAuth grant is still required. Preserve any cancellation history. Do not renew/reclaim or repeat the consequential task.
4. Read the exact job again. Require `stage: completed`, `completion.eventId` equal to the submitted event, `completion.runId` equal to the original run, `completion.replyId` equal to the original reply, and `completion.resultVersion` equal to the acknowledged version. Confirm the expired lease was not renewed and independently verify no extra external action occurred. A later correction must not rewrite that original attestation.
5. If the response is lost, first inspect the exact job/event. Any replay must use the identical event UUID and identical payload from the same original grant/run; require `newWrite: false` and one completion event. A denial is handled under the policy below, not by substituting new run IDs or editing arguments until accepted.

An operator can make a **private read-only Lucy execution probe** only through an already approved owner session and an already authorized route:

1. Choose one fixed, safe source the genuine Lucy host can actually read, such as `README.md` at an exact immutable candidate Git commit. Independently compute its Git-blob UTF-8 byte count and SHA-256, and retain a redacted check artifact. Choose a fresh nonsecret challenge UUID. No provider or new credential is configured for the probe.
2. Submit one private job with a stable request UUID and owner-supplied `action_kind: read_only`, asking the host to read that exact source and report the challenge UUID, byte count and digest. State that only read actions are requested. Existing owner identity and requested action determine authority; a fixture credential or public Muse prefix cannot substitute for it.
3. Close the browser before callback/host execution. Record the close time, saved request identity, existing subscription snapshot, callback evidence if present, real host trace and owning claim. Observe from existing read-only tools, without polling through a phone page that could hide the reconciliation gap. Reopening is an additional observation, not evidence of autonomous execution.
4. Require an actual source-read/tool trace and independently matching output, one immutable reply, and accepted typed completion from the matching real run/grant. Record request-save→callback, request-save→host-start, claim→reply and reply→typed-completion intervals separately. If callback acceptance exists without host evidence, the result is transport-only and the host execution gate stays blocked.
5. Inspect the exact request after the browser reopens. For a later correction, append a harmless factual correction only if the original owning workflow is authorized; read by exact ID and finish all result pages. Verify original reply/completion preservation. A creation-order pending/jobs cursor alone is insufficient for corrections.

A genuine Muse execution probe requires an explicitly authorized READY window and a reviewed, pinned producer source/host identity. This harness does not activate it, run its script, create live subscriptions, send public requests, alter schedules or upload artifacts. During an authorized window, use an existing owner-designated eligible request and existing route. If none exists, retain the gate as blocked instead of generating a public request.

During such an authorized window, require one genuine producer run/attempt associated with that exact existing request, an independent check of its actual read-only output, and an immutable publication/comment ID and versioned final report. Use producer trace evidence to distinguish receipt/preliminary/final output. To qualify lost-hint recovery, the one isolated occurrence must have no delivered hint and no browser reads; the actual normal host reconciliation path must import its final. Follow every result/changes page for that already answered request and a later correction, preserve the original reply, and verify no extra execution or upload occurred. A public report carries `author_authenticated: false`, `execution_authorized: false`; those values must stay false even when a reviewed host trace demonstrates real producer execution. No live fault injection is permitted into another user's route or a production schedule.

Restart, duplicate delivery, subscription failure and consequential-action recovery on genuine hosts need an explicitly isolated, already authorized test route or naturally occurring observation. Keep fault injection inside fixtures until that prerequisite is established. For an existing ambiguous consequential execution, inspect the original external outcome/read-only audit evidence and reconcile the original run; Relay root IDs are correlation IDs, not external provider idempotency keys. Never turn delivery recovery into a new execution or rely on an expired lease as evidence that an external action did not happen.

A denied genuine action must be recorded by exact tool/target request/run/event identity, time and returned error code, without logging credential or body. Stop that action. At most **one identical retry** is allowed, only with evidence that the same operation is authorized and its prerequisite has been repaired. Do not broaden scopes, create a new grant, impersonate the original run, invent `not_started`, activate another route, or retry a modified payload. The automated harness makes no genuine host write attempts.

The remaining acceptance gates are: actual candidate deployment identity; genuine host schema refresh/callability; owning-run terminal reconciliation where needed; a verified closed-browser Lucy read-only execution; explicit reconciliation ownership for MCP-only lost-hint readers; authorized Muse execution; real correction consumption; real persistence/dedupe/recovery observations; and deployed cost/latency evidence. Fixture passes, producer-reported tests, source inspection and callback delivery cannot close these gates.

The untouched relevant owner-job, correction, completion, integration, delivery, event, import-hint and read-cost contracts passed 171/171 locally. Qualification inventory and evidence validator checks passed 33/33 with the complete harness staged. The independent targeted harness remains intentionally red at the MCP-only recovery gate. The full local suite did not qualify under the available runtime/browser conditions. Release qualification must use the exact required toolchain and retain every original assertion.
